# Keyboard Height Provider
Getting keyboard height in android it's a pain in the ass. For activities where soft input mode is `adjustResize`, you can set up an `OnGlobalLayoutListener` and measure how the activity window is resized, to make room for the keyboard.

For other modes of soft input mode, you're out of luck. As the android brick-heads refuse to solve this problem even after 28 iterations of SDK development, someone came with a cool solution:
* create a pop-up window and observe it's global layout changes
* set it's soft input behaviour as `adjustResize`
* attach this popup window to your activity and let it report the keyboard height, based on it's layout changes.


## Set up

Note for existing users:
The package name has been changed to a domain name I own, as part of maven requirements.

Add the following dependency to your project:

```gradle
    implementation 'ro.holdone:keyboardHeightProvider:1.0.3'
```

## Usage

1. Keep a reference to `KeyboardHeightProvider` in your activity.

    ```kotlin
        private var keyboardHeightProvider: KeyboardHeightProvider? = null
    ```

2. Create a `KeyboardListener`

    ``` kotlin
    
        private fun getKeyboardListener() = object : KeyboardHeightProvider.KeyboardListener {
            override fun onHeightChanged(height: Int) {
                sizeText.text = "$height"
            }
        }
    ```

3. Create the height provider after your activity has been created and register the listener.

    ```kotlin
        override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
            setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
            keyboardHeightProvider = KeyboardHeightProvider(this)
            keyboardHeightProvider?.addKeyboardListener(getKeyboardListener())
        }
    ```
    
4. Override activity lifecycle and make sure you notify the `KeyboardHeightProvider`

    ```kotlin 
        override fun onResume() {
            super.onResume()
            keyboardHeightProvider?.onResume()
        }
    
        override fun onPause() {
            super.onPause()
            keyboardHeightProvider?.onPause()
        }
    ```
    

Also the `KeyboardInfo` object provides information about the current state of the keyboard, and it's cached height.

### Credits
All credits for this project goes to [Siebe Brouwer](https://github.com/siebeprojects). He had a great idea of using an android `PopupWindow` in order to extract the keyboard height in activities where you don't want to use the `adjustResize` behaviour.
